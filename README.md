` My English is very poor... So I am sorry to tell you that I could not describe the framework of the program `<br>
This program is one of my homeworks which requires us to write it withou "class". Using method: First, input the height and width of the maze. Then, enter Enter to start solving the maze. Every entering will make the program output one-step.
